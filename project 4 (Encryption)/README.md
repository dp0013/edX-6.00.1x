# Encryption
This was a project from week 5 of MIT's edX "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" (6.00.1x) course. The purpose was to create a program that would both encrypt and decrypt a message using the well-known "Caesar cipher" method (i.e., a number is chosen from 1 to 26 and each letter in the original message is "shifted" by that number of letters to produce an encrypted message).

cipherTextMsg.py deciphers the message encrypted in the story.txt file.
