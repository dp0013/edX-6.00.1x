# Optimal Monthly Payment (Bisection Method)
The purpose of this project was to practice using bisection search methods to determine the optimal monthly payment (i.e., within .01 cents) required to pay off any original balance for anhy interest rate within 12 months. Although the problem set consisted of three parts, only the final code was included in this repo since each part was progressive and merely built upon its predecessor.
